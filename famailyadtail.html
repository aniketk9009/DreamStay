    <h1>Family Apartment</h1>
    <p> 
A family apartment typically includes a living area, kitchen, bedrooms (often multiple), and bathrooms. The specific layout and number of rooms can vary, but the emphasis is on providing comfortable living space for a family, often with a designated dining area and potentially a family room for recreation.
